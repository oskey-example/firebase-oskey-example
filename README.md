## About

This is an example project to run a cloud app on Firebase (project
oskey-example). This repository provides the backend side (Auth,
Cloud Firestore, Cloud Functions and Cloud Storage) and a fontend web app.

Emulators and unit tests are available, along with CI/CD to deploy releases
online.

It is provided under the MIT License.

## Getting started

### Requirements

#### Using VS Code and dev container (recommended)

- Linux or Mac
- git: Any git client should work
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (latest version)
- Docker (latest version)

Using the VS Code dev container will ensure all requirements are met. In
addition, all is contained, so you don't have to mess with you local Node
installation (node, npm, ...).

_Note:_ For Windows users, you have to make adjustment to the dev container.

Once the dev environment has started, you need to finish the configuration (to
get a nice `vim` and `tmux` config):

```sh
~/setup.sh
```

#### Building and testing locally (not recommended)

- git: Any git client should work
- [node](https://nodejs.org): v18.x (latest LTS version supported by Firebase)
- [firebase-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools): v11
- [Java OpenJDK Runtime Environment](https://): v19

_Note:_ `firebase-tools` are not required to be installed globally, using `npx`
command will call the one installed with the program dependencies. The dev
container provides a `firebase-cli` that is a shortcuts to `npx firebase` and
that can detect if a token is set in the `env`. If you cannot copy the file
(located in `.devcontainer/`), you will have to update the scripts on the
`package.json` file at the root of the project to call `npx firebase` instead of
`firebase-cli`.

### Clone and download dependencies

Clone the repository
[oskey-example/firebase-oskey-example](https://github.com/oskey-example/firebase-oskey-example)
then download the dependencies (at root level: `firebase-tools` and for the
Cloud Functions):

```sh
git clone git@github.com:oskey-example/firebase-oskey-example.git
cd firebase-oskey-example
npm ci
```

### Create a Firebase project and update configuration

Prior to running the emulator, it is required to login. However you probably
won't have access to the Firebase project set by default, therefor you need to
create a project on Firebase (a Google email account is required for that). On
you Firebase project you need to activate:

- Authentication (email/password)
- Firestore
- Cloud Function (it will ask you to have a `Blaze` plan, but it should not cost
  you anything unless you deploy and start having many request. For your own
  testing you should not exceed the free tier, but be careful)
- Storage
- Hosting
- Dynamic link

Once it is done, you need to add in `.firebaserc` a configuration for your
project. For example (replace `PROJECT_NAME` by you project name):

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "dev": "oskey-example",
    "prod": "oskey-example",
    "my-project": "PROJECT_NAME"
  },
  "targets": {
    "oskey-example": {
      "hosting": {
        "oskey-example": ["dynlink-oskey-example"]
      }
    },
    "PROJECT_NAME": {
      "hosting": {
        "PROJECT_NAME": ["dynlink-PROJECT_NAME"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Finaly you need to update `firebase.json`. For example (replace `PROJECT_NAME`
by you project name):

```json
{
  "firestore": {
    "rules": "firestore/firestore.rules",
    "indexes": "firestore/firestore.indexes.json"
  },
  "functions": {
    "predeploy": ["npm --prefix \"$RESOURCE_DIR\" run lint", "npm --prefix \"$RESOURCE_DIR\" run build"],
    "source": "./functions"
  },
  "hosting": [
    {
      "target": "oskey-example",
      "appAssociation": "AUTO",
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "/app/**",
          "dynamicLinks": true
        },
        {
          "source": "/auth/**",
          "dynamicLinks": true
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "target": "PROJECT_NAME",
      "appAssociation": "AUTO",
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "/app/**",
          "dynamicLinks": true
        },
        {
          "source": "/auth/**",
          "dynamicLinks": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "storage": {
    "rules": "storage/storage.rules"
  },
  "emulators": {
    "ui": {
      "enabled": true,
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 19000
    },
    "auth": {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 19001
    },
    "firestore": {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 19002,
      "websocketPort": 19097
    },
    "functions": {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 19003
    },
    "storage": {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 19005
    },
    "hub": {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 19006
    },
    "eventarc": {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 18098
    },
    "logging": {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 18099
    }
  }
}
```

_Note:_ You may also just replace in both file all iterations for
`oskey-example` by you project name.

Once the configuration is ready, you need to login to Firebase:

```sh
firebase-cli login
```

Then, you need to set to your project (for example):

```sh
firebase-cli use my-project
```

### Build Cloud Functions

The Cloud Functions must be build prior to running emulator. To do so go into
the `functions` folder and:

```sh
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run build
```

During development, it may be more interesting to rebuild code automatically,
as the Cloud Function emulator is able to reload. To do so:

```sh
npm run build:watch
```

_Note:_ In some cases, the emulator is not able to properly reload, though no
errors are reported. In this case stop the emulators, restart the build/watch
command and restart the emulator. If the problem persist, it could be because
some import do not properly refer to the module (`@oskey/*`) or should have a
path like `/src/...` instead of `../../../`.

### Run the emulator

Each emulator configuration can be found in the config file `firebase.json`.
Scripts in the `package.json` file at the root of the project can be tweaked to
match your requirements.

The emulator can be started using the following command, from the root folder of
the project:

```sh
npm run emul
```

There are additional scripts available:

- `npm run emul:export`: export the data when the emulators stops (to run on the
  same data other tests)
- `npm run emul:import`: import the data exported from a previous run

### Build and watch the code changes

...

### Unit testing (Cloud Functions, Firestore rules and indexes, Storage rules)

#### Configure testing

Prior to running the unit tests, the config file `config.json` must be set in
the `test` folder (a `config.json.dist` file is available for reference).

Here's an example:

```json
{
  "projectId": "oskey-example",
  "region": "europe-west",
  "hubHostname": "localhost",
  "hubPort": 19006
}
```

This may be required is you made changes to the Firebase config (`.firebaserc`
and/or `firebase.json`).

The unit tests can be run in two ways:

- While the emulators run
- Along with emulators (no emulators should already be running)

#### While the emulators run: during development

In this scenario, the emulators are usually running while code is been changed,
then when the code is, the test may be run.

The hub is used to get the detail about the emulators, so it self configures.

Then, the dependencies must be downlaoded. To do so run `npm ci` in the `test` folder.

To run unit tests while the emulators is started, go to the `test` folder then:

```sh
npm test
```

**Important**: The units deletes all existing data and user prior to running the
tests.

There are additional scripts:

| Command                  | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| npm run test:bail        |  Same as npm test, but the test stops at the first failure                                 |
| npm run test:export      |  Same as npm test, the data are then exported for future import with `npm run emul:import` |
| npm run test:export:bail |  Same as npm run test:export, but the test stops at the first failure                      |
| npm run test:progress    |  Same as npm test, but the output only shows the test progress, not all the log            |

#### Along with the emulators: CI/CD workflow, git hooks and other scenarios

To run unit tests along with the emulators (it will start the emulator, run the test then shutdown the emulator), run
the following command from the **root folder** of the project:

```sh
npm test
```

There are additional scripts:

| Command                  | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| npm run test:bail        |  Same as npm test, but the test stops at the first failure                                 |
| npm run test:export      |  Same as npm test, the data are then exported for future import with `npm run emul:import` |
| npm run test:export:bail |  Same as npm run test:export, but the test stops at the first failure                      |
| npm run test:progress    |  Same as npm test, but the output only shows the test progress, not all the log            |
| npm run test:ci:json     |  Same as npm test, used in CI/CD workflows                                                 |

These commands are usefull if it is required to perform a full test in pre-commit or
pre-push git hooks.

## Auth

The following authentication methods are available:

- Email/Password

## Cloud Firestore

Rules and indexes can be found on in the folder `firestore`.

## Cloud Functions

Function code can be found on in the folder `functions`. They are coded in
`Typescript` and uses `eslint` to enforce coding standard.

## Cloud Storage

Rules can be found in the folder `storage`.

## Hosting

An example of hosted app in available in the folder `public`. It uses
[Angular](https://angular.io) with
[@angular/material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/material) for
the UI and [@angular/fire](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/fire) for
as Firebase SDK.

## Emulators and unit tests (backend)

Unit test code for the backend (Auth, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Functions and Cloud
Storage) can be found in the folder `test`. They are coded in `Typescript` and
uses `eslint` to enforce coding standard. `Mocha` + `chai` is used to
orchestrate the tests.

In addition, the package [gp-firebase-emulator-unit-test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gp-firebase-emulator-unit-test)
is used to provide a framework to unit test on Firebase emulators.

When running the emulators, it will download the adequate versions.

The emulators will use the following port (if you use the provided configuration):

| Emulator        | Port  |
| --------------- | ----- |
| Auth            | 19001 |
| Cloud Firestore | 19002 |
| Cloud Functions | 19003 |
| Pub/Sub         | 19004 |
| Cloud Storage   | 19005 |

These additional ports will be run for the emulator engine itself.

| Additional server | Port  |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| Emulator UI       | 19000 |
| Emulator Hub      | 19006 |

## Deployment to Firebase

This project contains both script for deployment via Github Actions triggered
when a new release is created on [Github](https://github.com) or a
`npm run deploy` command to trigger the deployment manually.
